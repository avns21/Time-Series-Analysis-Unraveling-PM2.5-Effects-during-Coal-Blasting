# Key Points Regarding the project-
# 1- Implemented ARIMA model for PM2.5 time series data, including ADF test for stationarity assessment and selection of optimal order (3,1,2) based on minimum AIC value, enhancing forecasting accuracy.
# 2- Evaluated PM2.5 and other pollutants distribution using QQ plots, identifying deviations from normality & assessing similarity with normality.
# 3- Developed an AQI calculation method based on PM2.5 data, utilizing Indian standards and equation to determine air quality index, ensuring accuracy in assessing pollution severity which was verified by Coal India Employee.
